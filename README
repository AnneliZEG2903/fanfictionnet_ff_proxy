*** fanfictionnet_ff_proxy: an experimental "proxy" for fanfiction.net ***
/!\ Very hacky/buggy code - USE WITH CAUTION

This code permit a manual bypass of the CloudFare captcha for FanFiction.net
It used to Firefox but now we use Chromium since we can delete navigator.webdriver on this browser.

** INSTALLATION **
First, check the docs folder. If the documentation for your platform is missing, try:
* Update your pip to have working dependancy  resolution: python3 -m pip install --user -U pip
* Install the requirements: python3 -m pip install --user -U -r requirements.txt

** FanFicFare Configuration **
You will need to edit FanFicFare' personal.ini to enable this proxy.
Add this:

[www.fanfiction.net]
use_nsapa_proxy:true
use_cloudscraper:false

** USAGE **
* Run python3 ./chrome_content.py
* Wait until 'Listening on 127.0.0.1:8888' is printed
* You can now use FanFicFare :)

Try, in FanFicFare folder:
$ PYTHONPATH=.
$ export PYTHONPATH
$ python3 ./fanficfare/cli.py -c personnal.ini -d 'https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12266465/1/' 

 ,
/!\ If you see "Complete the captcha then press enter", switch to the Chromium window and do the captcha.
¨¨    Press Enter when you're done, the page will reload and you should see the source code of the URL you request

Do this a first time so cookie.json is initialized
Control+C should close everything.

If you have docker, you can do a 'make run' then open your browser at http://localhost:8080/.


** FanFicFare Version Requirement **
The required code was first available in FanFicFare in version 4.1.7 but nowaday we require
version 4.4.0.
