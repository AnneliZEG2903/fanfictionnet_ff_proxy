*** fanfictionnet_ff_proxy: an experimental "proxy" for fanfiction.net ***
/!\ Very hacky/buggy code - DO NOT USE.

This code (with the included very hacky patch for FanFicFare) permit a manual bypass of the CloudFare captcha for FanFiction.net
It drive Firefox through Selenium.

** USAGE **
* Run python3 ./ff_content.py
* Wait until 'Ready to accept command!' is printed
* You can now use your patched FanFicFare :)

/!\ If you see "Complete the captcha then press enter", switch to the Firefox window and do the captcha.
¨¨    Press Enter when you're done, the page will reload and you should see the source code of the URL you request

Do this a first time so cookie.json is initialized
Control+C quit the browser, do it twice to quit the software

The patch is for FanFicFare git rev 03b93bb9d7cd77cd4e92eeee93095a9223ba3c71 (Sun Mar 21 10:13:53 2021 -0500)

You will need to edit FanFicFare' personal.ini to enable this proxy:
[www.fanfiction.net]
use_fanfictionnet_ff_proxy:true
use_cloudscraper:false

Then you call FanFicFare by being in its directory and doing
$ PYTHONPATH=.
$ export PYTHONPATH
$ python3 ./fanficfare/cli.py -c personnal.ini -d 'https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12266465/1/'
