*** fanfictionnet_ff_proxy: an experimental "proxy" for fanfiction.net ***
/!\ Very hacky/buggy code - USE WITH CAUTION

This code permit a manual bypass of the CloudFare captcha for FanFiction.net
It used to Firefox but now we use Chromium since we can delete navigator.webdriver on this browser.

** USAGE **
* Run python3 ./chrome_content.py
* Wait until 'Listening on 127.0.0.1:8888' is printed
* You can now use FanFicFare :)

 ,
/!\ If you see "Complete the captcha then press enter", switch to the Chromium window and do the captcha.
¨¨    Press Enter when you're done, the page will reload and you should see the source code of the URL you request

Do this a first time so cookie.json is initialized
Control+C should close everything.

The required code is available in FanFicFare since version 4.1.7.

 ,
/!\ NOTICE: We have a potential fix for the "truncated reply" error
¨¨              on this fork: https://github.com/nsapa/FanFicFare/tree/fix_truncated

You will need to edit FanFicFare' personal.ini to enable this proxy:
[www.fanfiction.net]
use_nsapa_proxy:true
use_cloudscraper:false

Then you call FanFicFare by being in its directory and doing
$ PYTHONPATH=.
$ export PYTHONPATH
$ python3 ./fanficfare/cli.py -c personnal.ini -d 'https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12266465/1/'
